दिल्ली के नजफगढ़ के छावला इलाके में बैंक लूट की एक ऐसी वारदात वारदात सामने आ रही जिससे पूरा इलाका दहशत में है। दरअसल छावला इलाके में स्थित कॉर्पोरेशन बैंक की एक ब्रांच में आज लूट की वारदात अंजाम दी गई जिसमें कैशियर की हत्या कर दी गई।&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
अब तक मिली जानकारी के अनुसार छावला इलाके के कॉर्पोरेशन बैंक में 4 बदमाश घुस आए। जब वह वारदात को अंजाम दे रहे थे तो कैशियर ने उनका विरोध किया इसके बाद बदमाशों ने कैशियर को गोली मार दी और बैंक लूटकर फरार हो गए।&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
घटना की जानकारी मिलते ही पुलिस मौके पर पहुंची और मामले की जांच कर रही है। हालांकि अभी इस बात की जानकारी नहीं मिल सकी है कि बैंक में कितने की लूट हुई।&quot;

### [Data and Time Format at Article Detail Pages](https://trello.com/c/09t0EV3z/203-data-and-time-format-at-article-detail-pages "Data and Time Format at Article Detail Pages") ###






Hi Ravi G,

During my analysis I found that there are two different date and time formats on Amar Ujala. One is at article detail page and other is at news sitemap.

At Detail Page: Wed, 06 Sep 2017 12:27 PM IST

At News sitemap: 2017-09-06T13:05:15+05:30

As Google's crawler would accept any of the below format:

Complete date
YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 1997-07-16)

Complete date plus hours and minutes
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD (e.g., 1997-07-16T19:20+01:00)

Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (e.g., 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)

Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a second
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (e.g., 1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00)

Therefor, we need to update the date and time format on article/news detail pages as news sitemap.

BR,
Sandeep

### [SEO - Rel=Next Prev Missing](https://trello.com/c/D8HQ3oSp/187-seo-relnext-prev-missing "SEO - Rel=Next Prev Missing") ###


 `MAJOR` 



During my analysis I found that pagination tag Rel=Next Prev on category, sub-category, video categories, photogallery in head section is missing.

Please implement these tags to relate our paginated pages to each other.

For Ex:
India News Page: http://www.amarujala.com/india-news

At Main page: http://www.amarujala.com/india-news (Only put rel=next tag)
&lt;link rel=&quot;next&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amarujala.com/india-news?page=1&quot; /&gt;

At 1st page:
&lt;link rel=&quot;prev&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amarujala.com/india-news&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;next&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amarujala.com/india-news?page=2&quot; /&gt;

Similarly for other pages like 2, 3, 4, and all.

At Last Page: (Only put rel=prev tag)
&lt;link rel=&quot;prev&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amarujala.com/india-news?LastPage-1=ID&quot; /&gt;

Kinldy let me know if you have any query.
